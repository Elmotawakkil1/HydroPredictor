# HydroPredictor

**HydroPredictor** is a hybrid machine learning framework designed to forecast groundwater storage levels and classify groundwater potential zones, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The model integrates multiple machine learning algorithms and uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize model performance.
